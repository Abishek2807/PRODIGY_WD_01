## Project Title: Interactive Navigation Menu

### Overview
This project is a simple web page with an interactive navigation menu that changes appearance when the user scrolls down. The page includes four sections: Home, About, LogIn, and SignUp, each accessible via the navigation bar at the top of the page. The menu is fixed at the top, providing easy access to the different sections of the page as the user scrolls.

### Features
- **Fixed Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar remains at the top of the screen as the user scrolls.
- **Scroll-based Style Change**: The navigation bar changes its background color and adds a shadow when the user scrolls down.
- **Responsive Design**: The menu adapts to different screen sizes thanks to its responsive layout.
- **Font Awesome Icons**: The navigation items include icons for a modern look.

### Files and Dependencies
- **HTML (index.html)**: Contains the structure of the web page.
- **CSS (embedded in HTML)**: Handles the styling of the page, including the navigation bar, sections, and scroll effects.
- **JavaScript (embedded in HTML)**: Adds interactivity, specifically the scroll-based background color change of the navigation bar.
- **External Libraries**:
  - Font Awesome: Used for the icons in the navigation menu. It is loaded via a CDN.
  
### Installation
No installation is required. Simply open the HTML file in a web browser.

### Usage
1. Open the HTML file in any modern web browser.
2. Scroll the page to see the navigation bar's style change as you move past the 50px threshold.
3. Click on any of the navigation links (Home, About, LogIn, SignUp) to quickly navigate to the corresponding section on the page.

### Customization
- **Changing Colors**: 
  - Modify the `background-color` and `color` properties in the CSS to adjust the appearance of the navigation bar and text.
  - Change the hover effect color in the `nav ul li a:hover` selector.
- **Adding Sections**: 
  - To add new sections, simply create new `<section>` tags in the HTML and add corresponding links in the `<ul>` list inside the `<nav>` tag.
